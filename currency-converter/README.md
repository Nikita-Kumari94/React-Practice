# Currency Converter (React Practice Project)

A simple currency converter built using React that converts values between different currencies using real-time exchange rates fetched from a public currency API.

This project was created to practice **custom hooks, API integration, and component-based design in React**.

---

## Features

- Convert currencies in real time
- Swap between "From" and "To" currencies
- Dynamic currency options fetched from API
- Clean and responsive UI
- Uses custom React hook for data fetching

## API Used

Exchange rate data is fetched from:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/{currency}.json

The API provides up-to-date currency conversion rates in JSON format.

This project was built purely for **practice and fun** while learning React, hooks, and API integration.
